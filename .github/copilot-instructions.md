This is a Next.js web application for managing a queue on a site. The app includes features for:

1. Adding users to a queue
2. Displaying the current queue status
3. Processing people in the queue
4. Editing queue entries
5. Drag-and-drop queue reordering

Use modern React patterns including hooks and context for state management. The app uses Tailwind CSS for styling and supports dark mode.
